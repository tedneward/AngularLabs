# AngularLabs

This README file contains the default Angular CLI-generated content, plus the lab instructions for each step. Each lab step is tagged with a branch, so to start on the first lab, simply `git checkout master`, examine the README file for the instructions, and begin.

## Lab 2: JokeListComponent

In this lab, we will build a component that lists the Jokes returned by the JokeService.

* *Generate the JokeListComponent.* 
  * First generate the JokeListComponent: `ng generate component JokeList`. This will create a subdirectory called `joke-list` that will contain four files, an HTML file, a CSS file, and like the Joke class from the previous lab, a Typescript file containing the component code and TypeScript test file (which will be suffixed with 'spec.ts').

* *Add the list of Jokes to the JokeListComponent.* 
  * Add an instance field, called "jokes", an array of Joke. In the `ngOnInit` method, set the "jokes" field to the result of calling the `getJokes` method on the JokeService. In a future lab, we'll get Angular to provide the service, but for now, just `new` one up in code.

* *Create the HTML template.* 
  * In order to loop through the array of Jokes, we need to use the `*ngFor` directive in the template. Use `*ngFor` on a `div` tag to loop through the jokes (using `let joke of jokes`). Inside the `div` tag, use template expression syntax (the double-curly-brackets syntax) to display each joke's setup and punchline. (Put the punchline in bold, just for that extra effect.)

* *Reference the JokeListComponent from the AppComponent.* 
  * When the Angular CLI scaffolded out the application, it put some boilerplate HTML into the AppComponent, which is the "main page" of the application. Replace the entire AppComponent HTML template with an `h1` that displays the title, and then use the JokeListComponent selector (which would be `app-joke-list`, if you didn't change it) to display the list of jokes. Make sure to have both opening and closing tags. 

At this point, the JokeListComponent and related changes are finished. If you are not sure if you got it all to work, you can always fast-forward to the next lab by doing a `git checkout lab-3`.
